# partime
partime is an utility for my eyes. This little programm starts playing a sound every 20 minutes,
which means that I need to take a break and stop looking at the screen and then after 20 seconds it 
starts playing another sound, which means I can look at my screen again.

partime binary must be placed in the same directory as the start.mp3 file to play the start sound
and the stop.mp3 to play the stop sound.
